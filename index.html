    </h1>

    <b> All Pure HTML Learnings </b>

    <p align ="justify" p style="text-align:center;">
 
        First of all I would like to thank Mr. Criztian Tuplano, my gigachad and absolutely goated
        teacher for launching this wonderful initiative for tech career shifters and students alike.
        Althought the bootcamp is short, and only covering HTML and CSS for a total of 2 weeks, in 
        the first week, I already learned a lot about how important HTML is, as apparently it is the 
        backbone and the one that provides structure to websites. I'm not sure if I am really to tackle
        CSS as it has always been one of my weaknesses, but I am pretty excited and psyched up to learn 
        it from Mr. Criztian with all of his fun antics. I am also hoping he doesn't relapse after his
        teaching sessions too hard, "Hahahaha"

                <td width="100" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> I learned about what HMTL 
                    is for, and how it interacts with modern browsers 
                    like Google Chrome.</td>

                <td width="100" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> Text Editors And IDE's</td>
                <td width="100" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> I learned about various text editors like Notepad
                    Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio.
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I also learned about the disdain of the
                        instructor towards Notepad.
                    </p> 
                </td>

                    <td width="100" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;">HTML Elements </td>
                    <td width="100" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> I learned about the H1 to H5 tags, and how no one else uses them past H3, 
                        next up I also learned about the P tag which allows me to write paragraphs in HTML.
                        <p> Then I learned about the br tag which breaks the line, and 
                            allows me to separate paragraph texts and other elements for a smoother user experience.
                        </p>

            <tr align="center"></tr>
                <td width="300" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Images </td>
                <td width="300" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> I learned about how to insert images in HTML using the image src tag.

                    <p> I also learned how to properly call images in files, as Mr. Criztian heavily emphasized that I should not use
                        absolute pathing in terms of computer directory.
                        
                        <p> We should not use absolute pathing in computer directory's for images since it will be hard to debug
                            once the application becomes way bigger. 
                            
                            <p> Furthermore for the same reason we should also not name our
                                images with capital letters or with spaces, this also applies to videos, and audio files.</p>

                    <td width="100" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Audio</td>
                    <td width="100" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> I learned how to implement mp3 audio files using HTML,
                        courtesy of the audio controls tag. 
                        
                        <p>Additionally, from further researching online I was able to find out that you can use autoplay
                            muted loop, to have the audio loop while muted  and autoplayed so that it's not annoying for the website visitor.      
             </tr>
         

            <tr>

                    <td width="100" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> I learned how to input video files with the most popular being mp4 using the video and src tag.
                        
                        <p> Now like HTML audio, you can use autoplay muted loop in 
                            order to have it be a much more pleasant experience for the website user.
                        </p>

                    <td width="100" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> I learned that using the iframe tag along with common
                        functions such as width and height will allow you to link a Youtube URL to your website.

                        <p>Additionally you can also use Youtube itself to copy and inject some code that will allow you to embed the 
                            Youtube video on your website.
                        </p>

                    <td width="00" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Styles</td>
                    <td width="300" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> I learned  that just like in CSS, you can use
                        the style attribute in order to style your website even though it is only in pure HTML.
                        
                        <p> You can do this by using the style background-color
                            attribute which allows you to set the color by using it's name, or using RGB values. </p>
                        </td>
            </tr>

                    <td width="100" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Formatting</td>
                    <td width="100" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> During the HTML formatting session, I learned
                        that you can use the b tag to format your text in Bold letters, 
                        
                        <p> The strong tag which is similar to the important tag
                            can be used in a text with high importance. 
                        </p>
                        <p> The i tag which can be used to italized your text, and finally the small tag which as the 
                            name suggests can be used to make your text smaller.
                        </p>
                       </td>
            </tr>
         
            <tr>
                <tr align="center"></tr>
                    <td width="300" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Comments </td>
                    <td width="300" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> Now normally in any programming language out there,
                        you would just need to input // in order to leave comments, but in HTML it's completely different.

                        <p> In order to comment in HTML you need to use the < followed up by !-- then close the tag with the > symbol. </p>
                        </td>
            </tr>
         
            <tr>

                    <td width="300" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Lists </td>
                    <td width="300" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> Here I found out that you can make lists in
                        HTML using the ul and li tags, these lists are unordered lists.
                    <p> For ordered lists we use the ol tag and of course it's followed up by the li tag as well as it never
                        works without it.
                    </p>
                    </td>
            </tr>

                    <td width="300" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Links</td>
                    <td width="400" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> Apparently in order to be able to link either a hyperlink, a video, an image
                    or any location in general such as the frontpage of Google, all you have to do is use the a href tag followed by the link, and then
                    a quick description about it.
                    </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <tr align="center"></tr>
                    <td width="400" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Tables </td>
                    <td width="400" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;">This one took me a while to learn, as it was a bit tricky 
                        when I first looked at it during the live sessions.
                <p> Though once I started applying it in the assigned project, everything started to click for me, now in order
                    to make a table you need to use the table tag, for it would be th and for the data inside the rows you would need to use the th tag.
                    Things like width, height, and centering the table can all be added in eithe table, th or tr tags.
                </p>
            </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <tr align="center"></tr>
                    <td width="100" align="center"style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> HTML Forms </td>
                    <td width="300" align="center" style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> This one was very tricky for me as well, as it has
                        plenty of nuances and circumstances that you need to be aware of it, in order to fully use it to it's utmost potential.

                        <p> In order to make a form in HTML, you need to first write a form tag, an input tag to define a single line of text,
                            then there's the label tag, it has a label element which is used to define labels for various elements such as checkbox, color data etc.
                        </p>

                        <p> The input type has three functions, one of them is the input type radio button, which serves to have the user
                            be able to pick out various options to choose from. Then there is the input type checkbox which is used in order to
                            display checkboxes for choices in HTML. 
                            
                            <p> Then there's the input type submit, which is used to for a submit button which will submitted
                                to a form handler, which is typically a file in a server with a script for processing input data. </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
