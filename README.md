I learned a lot in completing this HTML project, it gave me the feeling of being a true developer, looking up stuff on the internet to figure out stuff, researching
how to center a div in HTML and so much more, furthermore I actually coded a whole bunch this time around without some Youtube tutorials by my side. This may have 
only been a pure HTML project, but it taught me a lot, and from now on I need to be more consistent in order to become a great developer in the future.

Anyway if you want to fork or clone this project, just git clone it into your local machine, since it's only a single HTML file afterall. Additionally I also plan to revisit this
project in the future in order to add some styling onto it and improve it even more. Thanks for checking out this repository.
